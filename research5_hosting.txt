PRELUDE - a former personal project

Before I make any official notes,
I just want to say that I finally deployed my Big 2 app
that I have been working a while on successfully!

AKA - front-end deployed on netlify,
and back-end deployed on render!

I am on the free tier for both, 
but both services are pretty generous with their use restrictions.

All I had to do was make sure the proxy
(defined in vite.config.js)
was targeting the right backend server 
(aka something ending with onrender.com)

And that the backend express server
was including the front-end react server
(aka something ending with netlify.app)
in its CORS configuration!

Yay!
