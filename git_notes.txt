This recommended guide is so useful! -> https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

In summary, you can either start a new repo (git init), 
or clone an existing repo from a remote destination (git clone)
How to find repo path? -> go to the green code button on every repo (options are HTTPS, SSH, CLI)

git repositories are organized as trees, with the head pointing at the latest commmit

Made changes? Stage them (git add <filename> (or * for all))
Then commit them! (git commit -m "message")
This puts them in the head

Ready to send them to main? -> Do git push origin master (or whatever branch you desire)
Didn't clone originally? You can still add the remote destination with git remote add origin <URL>

There's different branches, too. They help isolate features from the main. 
Add a branch by "checking it out" -> git checkout -b name_of_feature
Want to go back to master? -> git checkout master
Want to push branch to origin? -> git push origin <branch>

Hey, lets see what main is up to! -> git pull
Hey, lets try to merge a branch with ours! -> git merge <branch>

Want to track status, differences, or logs?
-> git status, git diff branch1 branch2, git log

Want to edit configurations? -> git config
