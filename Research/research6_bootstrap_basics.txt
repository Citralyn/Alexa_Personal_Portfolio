What is Bootstrap?
-> premade UI components built on CSS and JS!
You could download the source code yourself
to see the compiled CSS and JS bundles.

NOTE: Some components use JS (alerts, carousels, dropdowns...)
while some are purely CSS.
Some even use Popper! (a floating element library)

How do you use Bootstrap components in your project?

Way 1:
You could include Bootstrap's CDN links in your HTML file.

EX:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Below is a bootstrap button.</h1>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</body>
</html>

Say I display the html file locally on my browser.

Because I included the CDN links, 
I can use any of the css classes/declaration blocks that Bootstrap provided
Thus, <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
will stylize the button according to whatever Bootstrap decided it to be.

What's a CDN link?
-> It's a URL that points to a resource on a CDN server.

You could also use Bootstrap by installing it with a package manager.

EX:
npm install bootstrap@5.3.3

Which would install all of the bootstrap css and js bundles
locally into the bootstrap folder in node_modules

Then to reference bootstrap in your js (or jsx) file,
you would include -> import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

Or alternatively, you could reference it in your html file:
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>

Bootstrap also puts emphasis on normalization of settings.

For instance, making sure viewport is compatible with all devices:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

Or using Reboot to correct rendering inconsistencies across browsers.

The last thing I want to conclude with my Intro to Bootstrap
is how to manually configure bootstrap with Vite.

Vite is a local development server (and build tool)
which you can either manually install or use a template.

Here are the steps to manually get Vite and bootstrap working together:

1. Make your project directory
2. Install Vite and Bootstrap using npm (i.e., npm i --save-dev vite)
3. You also need to install Sass (npm i --save-dev sass)

What is SASS? 
Standing for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, it's an extension of CSS
that allows mixins, variables, nested rules, and more!

Back to steps:
4. Add a src directory with a separate folder for your js and css files
// This is optional, but it's nice to keep things organized
5. Make a new main.js file and styles.scss file in their respective folders

What is a SCSS file?
It's a special file type that can compile SASS syntax into browser-friendly CSS

6. Add an index.html file into src
// the index.html file is the entry point for vite 
7. Add a vite.config.js file 
8. Edit the config file

EX:
// Vite looks for index.html at <root>/index.html
// Optionally, you can redirect root to the src directory (see below)
// You could also specify the output directory for your production build

import { resolve } from 'path'

export default {
  root: resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
  build: {
    outDir: '../dist'
  },
  server: {
    port: 8080
  }
}

9. Fill in the index.html file (mix in some Bootstrap!)

EX:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Bootstrap w/ Vite</title>
    <script type="module" src="./js/main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container py-4 px-3 mx-auto">
      <h1>Hello, Bootstrap and Vite!</h1>
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary button</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

10. Configure a script (in package.json) to start the vite server:

EX: 
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }
// now "npm run dev" will start the dev server

11. Import Bootstrap into the scss file
//@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";

12. Import Bootstrap and the css file into your js file
// import '../scss/styles.scss'
// import 'bootstrap'
