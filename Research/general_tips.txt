1. Need to search for a specific phrase in VSCode?
- go to the search bar 
- click "Search for Text" (or just press %)
- Type the text that you desire! 

2. Importing and Exporting in JS
- If you're exporting one thing (a class or function), 
- you can export default <name>
- Then you can import <newName> from <location> //newName can be anything
- If you have multiple things, you can export them with names 
- i.e., export { name1, name2 };
- And import them using their name (import { name1 } from <location>)
- I'm using <> for explanation purposes, you don't actually need angle brackets
