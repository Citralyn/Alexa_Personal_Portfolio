1. Need to search for a specific phrase in VSCode?
- go to the search bar 
- click "Search for Text" (or just press %)
- Type the text that you desire! 

2. Importing and Exporting in JS
- If you're exporting one thing (a class or function), 
- you can export default <name>
- Then you can import <newName> from <location> //newName can be anything
- If you have multiple things, you can export them with names 
- i.e., export { name1, name2 };
- And import them using their name (import { name1 } from <location>)
- I'm using <> for explanation purposes, you don't actually need angle brackets

3. SVGs
- PNG stands for portable network graphic
- SVG stands for scalable vector graphic
- You can draw/make designs in Canva (both on a tablet or computer),
- and export them as SVGs! Good for web icons!
- Canva also supports custom sizing, 
- so you could make a 512 by 512 (or similar) png logo,
- and use sips to convert it to a icns file! (for custom Apple App Icons)

4. Some Glazing of React and Bootstrap
- React Routing is the goat (makes things so easy)
- Bootstrap Components are the goat (so easy to use, so customizable)
- I especially like how Bootstrap handles nav bars! 
- And Bootstrap grids/the flex system handle super well too! (yay rows and cols)

5. Media goes wild
- lots of things i thik about colu,n or row with in bootstrpa docs and
- probably react too
- its about breakpoints
- copied (will delete later)
- Core concepts
//containers have breakpoints??
//can have responsive or fluid - will try out now
//i think normal container already sets a breakpoint, we test it out
Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design. Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use min-width in our media queries.

Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrapâ€™s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.
//set different number columns to span, at breakpoints 
// seeing the dif in action goes crazy <Col xs={11} md={4}>
..after going on random websites (wikipedia, doge, etc),
alot of thema rent prefirectly fluid but do seem to change at specific breakpoijnts
//fluid automatically sets 
/// ya 12 columns
//lots of rules with default

-> //export default? exporting one thing
-> //tuen u can import without curly brackets
//exporitng many thigns? improt with curly brackets (import {Nav, Link} from whatever)
//u can also export default and a random!

//something about -> Bs prefix
Another escape hatch is the bsPrefix prop available in many React-Bootstrap components. This prop allows you to override the default Bootstrap CSS classes applied to the component, providing a way to customize the component's styling beyond what's possible with standard Bootstrap classes.

// should probably have used m (for margin) p (padding) and h and w properties  more
.. like m-5 or h-100 etc
//may have to go in and adjust for all of that
//including the waypoints and stuff
//or at least, i need to go in and get rid of all the 
//ya all the {{width: 50vw}} or whatever
//actually might just be a bootstrap thing and not a bootstrap react

9
Remember
-> padding is the inner space! margin is the outer space!

I also need to go in and do all the breakpoint things,
bc my images and such are defnitely not adjusting when u minimize
or expand the screen 
//OR not?? maybe just pass in width and height into the images themself
//that always controls the image properly 

11 
//we can combine all fo these ntoes into one
// yeah, the way breakpoints work (if u set one for xs), like xs={6}, itll apply to all of it
// bc its like once it reaches this -> 
(and u cant go smaller than xs)
wheras if u set lg=12, it'll default to whatever it'll default, until it reaches lg 
->
