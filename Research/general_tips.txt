1. Need to search for a specific phrase in VSCode?
- go to the search bar 
- click "Search for Text" (or just press %)
- Type the text that you desire! 

2. Importing and Exporting in JS
- If you're exporting one thing (a class or function), 
- you can export default <name>
- Then you can import <newName> from <location> //newName can be anything
- If you have multiple things, you can export them with names 
- i.e., export { name1, name2 };
- And import them using their name (import { name1 } from <location>)
- I'm using <> for explanation purposes, you don't actually need angle brackets

3. SVGs
- PNG stands for portable network graphic
- SVG stands for scalable vector graphic
- You can draw/make designs in Canva (both on a tablet or computer),
- and export them as SVGs! Good for web icons!
- Canva also supports custom sizing, 
- so you could make a 512 by 512 (or similar) png logo,
- and use sips to convert it to a icns file! (for custom Apple App Icons)

4. Some Glazing of React and Bootstrap
- React Routing is the goat (makes things so easy)
- Bootstrap Components are the goat (so easy to use, so customizable)
- I especially like how Bootstrap handles nav bars! 
- And Bootstrap grids/the flex system handle super well too! (yay rows and cols)
