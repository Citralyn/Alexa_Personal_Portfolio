//ok this thign!

ACTUAL REVELATIOIN!

WE USE EXPRESS when we want to make API calls 

if u try to direclty make the API call from ur localhost server or osmething,
 u get a Origin http://localhost:5173 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 200

 so u have to handle it through express!

 then make an api call to express!
 lol xD 

 -> async..?
