//ok this thign!

//i think use fetch for api call 

hard part is the middlware -> authentication thing
to access database ig 

ACTUAL REVELATIOIN!

WE USE EXPRESS when we want to make API calls 

if u try to direclty make the API call from ur localhost server or osmething,
 u get a Origin http://localhost:5173 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Status code: 200

 so u have to handle it through express!

 then make an api call to express!
 lol xD 

 also, to access a req.body, u need to use the
 express.json() middleware function 
-> this apparently: A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object
 after the middleware (i.e. req.body), 
 or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, 
 the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred

im tired no jwt
